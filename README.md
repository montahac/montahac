# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-


class Bioinformatician:

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Montaha Chowdhury"
        self.role = "Aspiring Bioinformatician"
        self.language_spoken = ["mc_BN", "en_UK"]

    def say_hi(self):
        print("Thanks for visiting. I hope you enjoy what you see!")


me = Bioinformatician()
